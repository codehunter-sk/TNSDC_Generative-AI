# Landscape Image Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating landscape images. Using deep learning techniques, particularly GANs, the project seeks to create a model capable of generating realistic and diverse landscape scenes.

## Key Features

1. **Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Obtain a dataset containing landscape images. Preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency in image size, format, and quality.

2. **Model Development:** Implement GAN architectures using TensorFlow and Keras to train the model on the landscape image dataset. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to enhance the quality and diversity of generated images.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained GAN model using qualitative and quantitative metrics. Assess the visual fidelity, diversity, and realism of the generated landscape images.


## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
